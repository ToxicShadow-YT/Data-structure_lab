Start.

Read the number of terms in polynomial A and B.

3. Read each term as (coefficient, exponent).

4. Initialize result polynomial C.

5. Compare exponents of A and B:

• If equal, add coefficients and store in C.

• If A's exponent > B's exponent, copy term from A to C.

• Else, copy term from B to C.

6. Copy remaining terms from longer polynomial.

7. Display the resultant polynomial.

8. Stop.
