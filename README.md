# üß† Data Structures Lab

This repository contains C programs and algorithms implemented as part of the **Data Structures Laboratory**.  
Each program demonstrates core data structure concepts such as stacks, queues, linked lists, sorting, searching, and trees.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Compilation & Execution

To compile and run any C program:

```bash
gcc filename.c -o output
./output
